  description: |
    openseries is a project with tools to analyze financial timeseries of a single asset or a group of assets.
    It is solely made for daily or less frequent data. Its origin is that our fund company needed basic tools
    to present historical performance to clients. Tools that can also be shared with clients for their own use.
